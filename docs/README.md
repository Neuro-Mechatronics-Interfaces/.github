# NML-GitHub Organization #
This repo contains the README (in the `profile` folder), which renders the long documentation on the landing page of the `NML` GitHub organization.  
It also contains the source code for the [`WTF` NML code](https://code.nml.wtf) website (in `docs`). 
Please check [this tutorial](https://code.nml.wtf/tutorials/2023/02/10/adding-a-repo) for instructions on how to modify the contents of those folders when adding repos or other documentation to the organization.
