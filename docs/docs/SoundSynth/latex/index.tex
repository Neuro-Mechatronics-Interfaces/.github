This is a small compiled library for {\ttfamily C} synthesizing simple sounds/tones and playing them. The library was compiled for Windows 64-\/bit and should work with 64-\/ or 32-\/bit windows architectures.

To re-\/compile the executable {\ttfamily bin/play.\+exe} use the following command\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcc\ src/wsoundsynth.c\ -\/o\ bin/wplay.exe\ -\/Iinclude\ -\/lwinmm}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Dynamic Link Library}{Dynamic Link Library}}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
To re-\/compile the dynamic link library ({\ttfamily .dll}), use the following command\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcc\ -\/shared\ -\/o\ bin/WSoundSynth.dll\ -\/Iinclude\ src/wsoundsynth.c\ -\/lwinmm}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily -\/shared} option creates a shared object. ~\newline

\item The {\ttfamily -\/o} is what the output file is. ~\newline

\item The {\ttfamily -\/lwinmm} option links against the windows multimedia library. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Static Library}{Static Library}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
To re-\/compile the static library ({\ttfamily .lib}), use the following command\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcc\ -\/c\ src/wsoundsynth.c\ -\/Iinclude\ -\/o\ lib/wsoundsynth.o\ -\/lwinmm\ \&\&\ ar\ rcs\ lib/WSoundSynth.lib\ lib/wsoundsynth.o}

Assume we have the following project folder structure\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ (bash)}
\DoxyCodeLine{my\_project}
\DoxyCodeLine{|-\/-\/src}
\DoxyCodeLine{|\ \ |-\/-\/my\_code.c}
\DoxyCodeLine{|\ \ |-\/-\/my\_code.h}
\DoxyCodeLine{|}
\DoxyCodeLine{|-\/-\/include}
\DoxyCodeLine{|\ \ |-\/-\/wsoundsynth.h}
\DoxyCodeLine{|}
\DoxyCodeLine{|-\/-\/bin}
\DoxyCodeLine{|\ \ |-\/-\/WSoundSynth.dll}

\end{DoxyCode}
 To compile, you would use the following command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ (bash)}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcc\ -\/o\ bin/my\_executable.exe\ src/my\_code.c\ -\/Lbin\ -\/Iinclude\ -\/lWSoundSynth}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Note about gcc}{Note about gcc}}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
Note that to use {\ttfamily gcc} on a Windows 64-\/bit architecture, the simplest way is to download \`{}msys2\`{}, which will allow you to use {\ttfamily pacman} from an {\ttfamily msys2} terminal. You can first check to see if you already have {\ttfamily gcc} installed\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ (bash)}
\DoxyCodeLine{pacman\ -\/Q\ |\ grep\ mingw-\/w64-\/x86\_64-\/gcc}

\end{DoxyCode}
 If you see anything in the terminal following this command, it means you already have {\ttfamily gcc}. Otherwise, you need to install it (and probably the rest of the toolchain, such as a linker etc.)\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ (bash)}
\DoxyCodeLine{pacman\ -\/S\ mingw-\/w64-\/x86\_64-\/toolchain}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This will give several options for what you can install. If you are unsure what to do, just install all of them. ~\newline
 Finally, you may also want a toolchain for compiling 32-\/bit applications from your 64-\/bit Windows operating system. In that case, you can try\+: ~\newline
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ (bash)}
\DoxyCodeLine{pacman\ -\/S\ mingw-\/w64-\/i686-\/toolchain}

\end{DoxyCode}
 The last step is to make sure the folder with the correct binaries are on your {\ttfamily PATH} environment variable. Probably the best strategy here, on a Windows device, is as follows\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the Start menu and type Environment, this should bring up a Control Panel shortcut to "{}\+Edit the System Environment Variables."{} Click that. ~\newline

\item Click "{}\+Environment Variables..."{} at the bottom right. ~\newline

\item Under System Variables, click "{}\+New..."{} and define a new environment variable\+: {\ttfamily MINGW\+\_\+\+PATH}. If you installed {\ttfamily msys2} in the default location, then go to {\ttfamily C\+:/mingw64}. You will be looking for the sub-\/folder containing binaries. In my install, that is located at {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}msys64\textbackslash{}mingw64\textbackslash{}bin} -- so that is my {\ttfamily MINGW\+\_\+\+PATH} environment variable. ~\newline

\item Under User Variables, find {\ttfamily Path}. Click {\ttfamily Edit...} with {\ttfamily Path} selected. ~\newline

\item In the new popup, click {\ttfamily New} to add a new {\ttfamily Path} value. Enter {\ttfamily MINGW\+\_\+\+PATH\%}. Now, you can add or remove {\ttfamily MINGW\+\_\+\+PATH\%} from the user {\ttfamily Path} variable depending on what compiler needs you have. Click on the newly added value, and click {\ttfamily Move Up} until it is at the top of the list. This ensures we don\textquotesingle{}t accidentally find {\ttfamily gcc} somewhere else and use a different unintended version. Note that if you want to switch between i.\+e. {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}msys64\textbackslash{}mingw32\textbackslash{}bin} and {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}msys64\textbackslash{}mingw64\textbackslash{}bin} it might just be easiest to change the value of {\ttfamily MINGW\+\_\+\+PATH} environment variable. ~\newline
